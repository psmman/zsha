# tilde-switch plugin

By default, on some non-US keyboards of Macbooks like Swedish and Turkish, tilde key switched with a plus-minus key. So this plugin switches back the `Â±` key to `~` without needing any third-party tool or service.

To use it, add `tilde-switch` to the plugins array of your `.zshrc` file:
```
plugins=(... tilde-switch)
```
